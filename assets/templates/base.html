            <h2>Attacks on SCADA networks</h2>
            <p align="justify">SCADA system attacks mostly aim at Manufacturing
                plant shutdown, train system delays, and sewage system
                spillage. SCADA sector should enhance its capability to
                bolster security measures for both legacy and contemporary
                devices. This enhancement should be carried out in a manner
                that ensures profitability, particularly concerning remote
                SCADA devices situated beyond corporate networks, as well
                as local SCADA devices, including those deployed on
                factory premises. By implementing improvements, existing
                SCADA devices can gain the ability to regulate their
                communications, identify and alert about unauthorized
                access or unusual data flow patterns, and incorporate
                comprehensive policy management for heightened security.
                These advancements collectively contribute to elevating the
                security stature of SCADA devices, effectively safeguarding
                them against the majority of cyber threats</p>
            <p align="justify">Network communication (local and remote):
                SCADA networks employ several communication
                methods. Short-range communication utilizes serial
                communication, USB, and custom wired networks.
                Ethernet, TCP/IP, WiFi, dial-up networking,
                cellular packet data, and other protocols are utilized
                for long-distance communication. In addition,
                SCADA networks increasingly employ the Internet
                for long-distance communication and remote
                access</p>
