# 🔐 Securing SCADA Systems

### Advanced Threat Mitigation & Resilient Cybersecurity Strategies for Critical Infrastructure

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on **securing SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems** used in critical infrastructure such as power grids, water treatment plants, and industrial automation environments. The work combines **cybersecurity engineering, Python-based system development, and machine/deep learning techniques** to detect anomalies, mitigate threats, and improve the resilience of industrial control systems.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional SCADA systems rely on **legacy protocols (Modbus, DNP3)** that lack encryption and authentication. Combined with weak access control and limited intrusion detection, these systems are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks such as unauthorized access, DoS attacks, and manipulation of industrial processes.
